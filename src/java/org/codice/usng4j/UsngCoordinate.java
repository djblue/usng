 * This interface models a point in the United States National Grid coordinate system.
 * There are several valid formats for USNG coordinates.  A fully specified coordinate is formatted
 * like this:
 *
 * {@code <zone number><latitude band letter><space><grid column><grid row><space><easting><space><northing>}
 *   e.g. 18T WL 85628 11322
 *
 * Only {@code <zone number>} and {@code <latitude band letter>} are required. The grid letters are
 * required if easting and northing values are supplied. The easting and northing values have a
 * maximum length of 5 characters each (with an optional '-').
 *
 * Default implementations of this class are immutable and therefore threadsafe.
